    <p>I am a former Software Engineer at Amazon and recent grad from Penn State who finds joy in building half-baked projects and takes great delight in the art of prematurely optimizing my code. You can often find me playing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chess.com/member/imvshnkr">Bullet Chess</a> where I strive hard to flag my opponents after making a series of blunders.</p>
